# Bazel with Java in Visual Studio Code

This is small minimal repo to explore using Bazel with Java in Visual Studio Code.

It is also used to create "reproducers" for related issues.

Run on CLI with `bazelisk run //app` (**TODO:** Via Dev Container, with Bazelisk pre-installed.)

Open repo in VSC, and open e.g. `Main.java`, and you should be able to "navigate" to `Lib.java`.
If that does not work, then [Troubleshoot](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-vscode-java/blob/main/docs/troubleshoot.md).

PS: [LearningBazel](https://github.com/vorburger/LearningBazel/) is for non-VSC.
